# Syntropy Security Research Labs
**Status:** Operational | **Clearance:** Public

**Syntropy Security** is a private vulnerability research firm specializing in **Architectural Failure Analysis** of legacy financial and healthcare infrastructure. We do not run scanners; we reverse engineer the logic that scanners miss.

> "Entropy is the natural decay of complex systems. Syntropy is the engineered force that orders them."
